        <pre>                                                        03/19/2021 05:45am EDT | Updated March 19, 2021</pre>
        
        <p>It happens to the best of us. Our little hunger demons come to life in the evening, telling us we absolutely need a bowl of pasta before bedtime. Or maybe your friend makes a dinner reservation (back when we did such things) for 9 p.m.
        <br />
        <br />
        And now, during the pandemic, <a href="#">COVID-19</a> has thrown our routines even more out of whack. We’re at home more, not always sticking to regular mealtimes, and probably staying up too late. These habits might be causing us to eat too much too late, which can have health consequences.
        <br />
        <br />
        <a href="#">Mohd Bahul Mustafa</a>, a clinical research dietitian at Northwestern Medicine, is seeing all of this with his patients. He urges them to adopt <u>a routine eating pattern</u> and to stop eating after a set time each day.

                    <p>“The earlier, the better,” Doerfler said. “I really like my patients to be done eating for the night by 7 o’clock, maybe 7:30.”
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    But everyone’s lifestyle is different. Ideally, Doerfler said, you should finish your last meal early enough to allow for a 12 or 13-hour overnight fast.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <a href="#">Alexander Ford</a>, a registered dietitian and osteopathic physician, said the best time to stop eating for the day depends on your bedtime, what you’ve eaten and how much.“It’s not cookie-cutter,” Ford explained. “I would advise stopping your last meal around three to four hours before going to bed, so you can sleep through the night.” This is based on the fact that it takes about four hours for your stomach to empty after eating ― and larger, higher-fat meals may take a little longer.

                <header><h2><strong>Late night eating could cause digestion trouble</strong></h2></header>
                    <p>Going to bed soon after you eat could cause a slew of digestive issues, including indigestion and acid reflux.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <a href="#">Indigestion</a>, or an upset stomach, sometimes happens when you eat too much or too quickly, or consume fatty or spicy foods, alcohol or caffeine. You may feel bloated, extra full or even nauseous.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                        <a href="#">Acid reflux</a> occurs when some of the stomach’s acidic contents seep up into your esogus. It migause stinging in your throat or a sour taste in your mouth. Acid reflux can cause heartburn, too, which is a burning sensation in your chest. Al Bochi said lying down right after eating can make heartburn worse.

                <header><h2><strong>What to eat if you do want a late night snack</strong></h2></header>
                    <p>It’s OK to indulge your late night cravings sometimes. Ford said if you do, eat a light, portion-controlled snack. And eat real foods containing fiber and protein, not junk food, Al Bochi advised.

                    <br />
                    So, what’s the best late night snack? Here are some ideas, according to nutritionists.
                    <br />
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Cheese and crackers</li>
                        <li>Nuts</li>
                        <li>Yogurt</li>
                        <li>Trail Mix</li>
                        <li>Popcorn without Buttor</li>
                        <li>Peanut Butter and Apples</li>

                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>“Mindful eating is also getting back to the pleasure component of your meals by taking part in the meal, whether it’s focusing on smell, taste, texture and appearance, but also pacing yourself to savor the way the food tastes when you’re enjoying it,” Doerfler said.
